                    <p>We gather  to speak and to listen to Jesus as one community under His Lordship. All are  welcome to lift their hearts to him, aloud and in silent prayer. We can all  call on the Lord&rsquo;s Name, knowing that each prayer is lifted up to God by the  assembled community of faith. </p>

                    <a href="blog.html"><img src="img/sexy-poker2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                    <p>Remembering  our creator in the days of our youth (Ecclesiastes 12:1), our young Christians  meet on Friday evenings. This is a time to get to know each other and to share  our journeys as we grow into Christian adulthood. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just about  good clean let-your-hair-down FUN!</p>
