<p><strong>GOOD NEWS CLUB</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting off as a small church-based initiative, we have seen our group  grow from 5 to 25 children in just a few months. Our organization partnered  with the Burlington Care Centre in establishing this programme with children  between the ages of 6 to 11 years old. We now meet weekly on a Saturday. </p>
<p>The main focus of this club is to focus on moral regeneration  targeting a younger generation. In running this group, we are becoming more  aware of the many aspects of the Burlington community which destroys positive  and constructive character building in children. We also see this club as a  means of reducing children&rsquo;s attraction to life and soul-destroying  distractions on the streets.<br>
  </p>
<p>Amongst the areas we focus on are:</p>
<p><br>
  -What makes people good people or bad people.<br>
  -What are the rights and responsibilities of  children.<br>
  -How do we as children show respect for elders and  other community members.<br>
  -When we or other people are hurt, how can we deal  with our or their hurt and anger.<br>
  -Our actions have consequences. When we do right what  happens and when we do wrong what happens.<br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides helping children do a values-based reflection on and be  practical about various challenges they face, this club provides the children  with some escape from the volatile environments they live in. As they can be  very open at times, we are careful to provide a safe and confidential  environment in which to communicate. Sometimes we have to take individual  children aside to address very personal matters with them.<br>
  Nicky the club facilitator notes: <em>&ldquo;</em><em>The children were especially excited when we provided  them with some stationary, needed for the activities of the club . . .</em><em>I  have seen an incredible change in attitude and level of respect since they've  joined Good News Club, (they) want to be better at what they do every week.<br>
    </em> <br>
  The children are very  enthusiastic and show a real need for the club&rsquo;s activities.<br>
