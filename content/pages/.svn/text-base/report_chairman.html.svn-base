		Seda eThekwini AGM Chairman&#39;s Report 26 October 2012</h2>
	<img align="left" src="template/img/chairman.jpg" />

	<p>Seda-eThekwini's vision is “To be the centre of excellence for small enterprise development in the Durban region and KwaZulu Natal”.</p>
    
	<p>2011/12 has been a difficult period for our country due to the ongoing labour unrest throughout the country, which has impacted negatively on our enterprises, the country as an investment destination and the growth of the economy.</p>
	
	<p>On the SMME front the picture is not rosy. Our SMME's are still not paid on time, or within 30-days as regulated, which impacts negatively on their cash flows and sustainability and the regulatory environment is still not conducive to SMME development.</p>
	 
	<p>seda-eThekwini's services are, daily, being stretched beyond our borders and this has a negative impact on our limited financial and human resources.</p>
	
	<p>Despite these challenges we will endeavour to:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Increase the capacity of our service provision in our satellite centres;</li>
		<li>Vigorously recruit retired entrepreneurs to provide mentorship for our SMME's;</li>
		<li>Partner with our local government to send as many SMMEs as we can to exhibit their products nationally and internationally</li>
		<li>Partner with our local government to nurture and train the informal traders;</li>
		<li>Partner with legal stakeholders to second attorneys to offer legal advice to SMME's;</li>
		<li>Prepare and position SMME's to access government support programmes;</li>
		<li>Continue inculcating the culture of entrepreneurship, especially amongst the youth;</li>  
		<li>Create and implement programmes and projects that are going to improve the competitiveness and productivity of our SMME's.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The demand for our services is ever growing, despite our meagre resources.</p>
	
	<p>I am pleased to report though, that, once again we have received an unqualified audit report for the 2011/12 financial year, from external auditors Ngubane and Company.</p>
	
	<p>I also take this opportunity to thank the following companies for supporting our work by seconding their senior staff to serve on our board of directors. These corporates are: ABSA, Ithala, 
		Department of Economic Development and Tourism (DEDT) KZN, Toyota South Africa, Capitec Bank, Durban University of Technology, McCarthy Group and seda. We also thank the South Africa Sugar Association for continuing to kindly administer our staff payroll as an “in kind” donation.</p>
		 
	<p>In conclusion, we would like to thank our main funders, the eThekwini Municipality and seda for ensuring that we are able to fulfil our vision of being the centre of excellence for small enterprise development in the Durban region and KwaZulu Natal through the resources they give us to do our job.</p>
	<p>Last, but not least, on behalf of the board I would also like to thank our staff for the unwavering commitment they have shown in ensuring that we deliver on our mandate.</p>
