				CEO&#39;s Report SEDA-eThekwini AGM 26 October 2012</h2>
			<img align="left" src="template/img/ceo.jpg" /><br />
			<p>
				Late last year seda-eThekwini was approached by two of our stakeholders, the Department of Economic Development &amp; Tourism (KZN) and eThekwini Municipality&#39;s Business Support Markets and Tourism Unit to take over the administration of the Tradepoint South Africa &ndash; Durban.</p>
			<p>
				Tradepoints worldwide are the brainchild of the United Nations and are co-ordinated by the Geneva based World Tradepoint Federation (WTPF), since 2000.</p>
			<br />
			<br />
			<p>
				There are 100 Tradepoint offices throughout the world, in 70 countries and the main objectives are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Facilitation of export trade by small established, export ready, businesses, especially in third world countries;</li>
				<li>
					Provide these local businesses with global trade opportunities and an international marketing platform;</li>
				<li>
					Prepare local businesses, through training and coaching, to be export ready.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The incorporation of Tradepoint Durban into seda-eThekwini could not have taken place at a better or more appropriate time due to the current economic depression and collapse of world markets.</p>
			<p>
				The seda-eThekwini Board welcomed warmly the incorporation as a strategic move which is in line with our national government policy of encouraging south-south trade and more so to encourage trade with its BRICS parties i.e. Brazil, Russia, India and China, as well as SADC countries.</p>
			<p>
				The national government, TIKZN and eThekwini Municipality in collaboration with small business development agencies such as seda have done a great deal of groundwork to re-inculcate the culture of entrepreneurship amongst fellow South Africans who were previously excluded from the main stream economy. The strategy is more appropriate to encourage SMME&#39;s to look beyond street trading and government tenders but instead through the assistance of Tradepoint, look for markets beyond our national borders, especially in the neighbouring states such as Lesotho, Mozambique, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</p>
			<p>
				Tradepoint Durban will assist SMME&#39;s with:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Export trade awareness;</li>
				<li>
					Help SMME&#39;s to be export ready and take them through issues such as trade risks, customs duties and regulations, trade tariffs, trade barriers and foreign currency;</li>
				<li>
					Identify markets and trade leads in these countries;</li>
				<li>
					Offer basic training on costing, packaging and quality production;</li>
				<li>
					In collaboration with stakeholders such as the DTI and TIKZN, facilitate participation of our SMME&#39;s in trade missions and exhibitions;</li>
				<li>
					Place company profile onto Tradepoint website;</li>
				<li>
					Promote SMME products on the website;</li>
				<li>
					Create and link with strategic trade partners in neighbouring states;</li>
				<li>
					Organise information exchange workshops;</li>
				<li>
					Facilitate training on productivity and international trade standards.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Tradepoint Durban has traditionally been concentrating on international exhibitions in countries such as the USA and Europe, almost exclusively, albeit unintentionally, promoting arts and crafts. The new thrust in terms of sectors now includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Manufacturing, specialised footwear, animal and vegetable products;</li>
				<li>
					Food export and retail;</li>
				<li>
					Chemicals and allied industries such as household cleaning products;</li>
				<li>
					Agro-processing;</li>
				<li>
					Furniture and wooden products;</li>
				<li>
					And other unique products that compete with the best in the world.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Foreign trade, like any other form of business, is not going to be easy especially as research evidence regrettably indicates it is easier and cheaper to do business with Europe than with Africa, due to the lack of import-trade friendly policies, trade barriers and criminal acts.</p>
			<p>
				Tradepoint Durban, being located in Durban, is in a strategic gateway to both east and west and having the largest ports in the country should have all the ingredients to be a trendsetter for Tradepoint work throughout South Africa.</p>
