    2013 Winter Warmth was a blessing for the Burlington community where the  FOG family graciously gave clothes and blankets  to keep our children warm.</p>
  <p>Dire need for winter clothes and blankets led us to  arrange with Samuel Welfare and Mission Society to distribute blankets in  Malukazi. Over 120 children and 100 amagoko (grandmothers) gathered on a cold  morning at the end of May to receive the blankets. We did not imagine that the  need for these blankets was so great, and based on our modest means we were  unable to provide for all who had gathered that day. It was clear that in  future we should look at providing the same for at least 400 households during  this period.<br />

                      <p><strong>Annual Toy Story</strong><br />
                    Once a year, as part of our Christmas celebration, we take  great pleasure in providing children with fun and games and a kiddies&rsquo; meal. We  rejoice in the relationships that we have built with the children and community  over the past year. <br />
                    It is a sad fact that most of our children come from homes which cannot afford  to celebrate or hold joyous occasions just for children. This event usually involves  30 children. Through this modest vehicle we are able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Help the children prepare  a small concert for themselves </li>
    <li>Organize some of the community  members to participate </li>
    <li>Raise donations that went  directly to the children </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Our Annual Toy Story is thoroughly enjoyed by adult  volunteers and children alike.<br />
