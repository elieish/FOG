				<h4>ABOUT US</h4>
			  <p>Over 3 months, around 15 people came together in prayer,  fellowship and to discuss their interest to serve the neighbouring and less  fortunate communities. They looked for a fresh way to serve the Lord and were  ready. </p>
              <p>Members of this group had already gathered many years of  experience in providing community services and they are deeply committed  Christians. This time, they were keen to form an organization as a vehicle to enhance  their Christian impact. None in the group thought after meeting in different members&rsquo;  homes that they would ultimately establish a foundation. </p>
              <p>Supported by their growing members&rsquo; weekly sowing in  service and resources, a small commercial premises was rented. By the end of  January 2013, Foundation of Grace opened its doors to the people of God. Under  the leadership of Pastor Lazarus  Pillay, our church has but one focus – to  live, speak and do as Jesus would.</p>
